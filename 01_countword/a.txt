A baby pig called Wilbur is almost killed because of his status – he is the smallest pig that was born and he is considered to 
be useless and of no value. Charlotte, the spider, knows that the farmers are planning to kill Wilbur. She promises to make a 
plan to save his life. The farmers are surprised the next day when they see the words “some pig” written in the web Charlotte
has made.
